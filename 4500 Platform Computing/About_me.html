    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello i am Richard Cacciata. I am transfer student that has been in
    working towards a Computer Systems degree. I have taken very few computer classes so I always feel like I need to learn the next
    computer language every new class I take. It can be daunting at times, but I am hoping to push through it and finish the degree with a little bit of elbow grease and luck.
    It seems like alot of people including myself aren't fond of starting a connection unless the class ask for it which I can understand because maybe the major pulls the type of 
    personalities; however, if needed I feel that I could try to connect with others.</p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">I actually was working towards a nutrition degree but decided mid way that I really didn't want to pursue 
    that type of field so I swapped majors to Computer Systems.</p>
    <p>I have to admit working towards this field has given me some doubts because with the classes that need to be taken for this 
    degree. There are a lot of very different things that I need to learn that is difficult and I am not sure how learning 5+ computer languages with X amount of different programs that need
    to be learned is preparing me for the major, but i'll trust the system and slug through it.
